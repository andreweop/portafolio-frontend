                          <p>Living with passion is what I strictly adhere to. “Always do what you love” how much ever hackneyed this sounds it holds absolutely true. That's why I love coding. Not for the sole reason of “loving” to code but it helps me to get rid of the world and escape into a different dimension of my own. As I am a coding freak I love facing new challenges and enjoying the moment of solving new problems and completing new achievements. The art of coding is something I am always fascinated by.</p>

                          <p>I am a continuous learner. Learning for me equates to exploring new ideas and growing as an individual. I just cannot imagine my life devoid of designing. I freely express my creativity and imagination by designing.</p>
